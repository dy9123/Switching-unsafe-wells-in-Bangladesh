# Switching-unsafe-wells-in-Bangladesh
In this project, we used several machine learning techniques to determine whether we should switch 
off the unsafe wells in Bangladesh.
We aim to explore the most influential factors for switching unsafe wells. 
Models including Logistic regression, LDA, QDA, KNN were employed and the best model was chosen by their error rate. 
Results from different models are compared mainly based on their error rate and ROC.
